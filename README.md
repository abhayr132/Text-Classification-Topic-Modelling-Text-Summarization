# Text-Classification-Topic-Modelling-Text-Summarization---Case-Study

## Problem Statement
FashionKart allows consumers to buy latest products from e-commerce platforms. Customers can leave reviews of products and experience to help other users make their purchase choices.
 
Given the dataset of product reviews and recommendation status, build a text classification model that can correctly identify the users who will recommend the product in the future. Also provide key topics/themes emerging from the customer reviews along with visualisation charts.

## Data files
The dataset.csv file is the main file that contains the reviews and corresponding customer recommendation values. There are only two columns in the data - review and recommendation.  

## Approach
Build a text classifier that can predict whether the user will recommend the product or not. Apart from the text classifier, use relevant algorithms to extract and visualize the key topics from the reviews. 

## Evaluation Metric
The metric used for evaluating the performance of the model is accuracy and auc score (test data to be split from dataset.csv)   
Accuracy = Correct Predictions/Total Number of Predictions
